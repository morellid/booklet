# booklet project

this project aims at helping desining and organising a booklet of A5 pages from on A4 pages in portrait mode, folded in half.

The order of the pages needs to be calculated so when pages are printed and folded together the content is in the expected order.

The project is a python script that takes as input the number of pages in of the content, and will create a guide that illustrates how to reorganise the original A4 in portrait mode content so it will be ordered as expected when folded and put together.

The script assumes that there is a cover page. 

The script as an option to have an empty page at the beginning.

The script outputs a pdf where in each page is shown what should be put.
